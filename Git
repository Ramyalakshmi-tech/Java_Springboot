Git is a distributed version control system which means we have copy of our historys
if it is a centralized control system, copy of present code..
install it and check it in command prompt by "git config --global --list" , you will get the username and the user email..

staging area-- is the area where we ask git to work with
git init -b main - initiate in branch main by creating it
git status - gives main branch like branch name

type "git log" to check the commits and all..

if I want to add it to the staging area... use
"git add ." 
if i want the staging area to be committed
"git commit -m "first commit"

if i want to skip staging area, skip git add.
"git commit -a -m "second commit"

use 
"git diff" to see the new changes in working directory
if it is in staging area
"git diff --staged"

if i want to delete a particular file from the git ,
"git rm --cached creds.txt" and then remove from working directory and then commit it to git

if we want to work with 5 or more workers in the same project,
usually, we use github,gitlab or bitbucket by Atlassian has been used

If I want to commit using ssh link than https link, it will create a ssh key
"ssh -keygen -o"
it will create a key , click enter and "cd" and "ls-a"
"cat id_rsa.pub"

we can add tag to the push by using "git tag v1.0" -m "18 dec 2024"
"git push origin v1.0"

we can clone the repository by using "git clone url.git"
also "git clone -b main url.git"

Inorder to reduce the bug impacts in main branch...people push it in other branches
"git checkout feature1"  we dont have branch called feature1

for creation
"git checkout -b feature1" or
"git switch -c feature2"

"git branch" gives the list of branches and pointer in the active branch
if we use "git switch main" it will go to main branch
"git switch -" go to previous branch
For deleting the branch feature1
"git branch -d feature1"
