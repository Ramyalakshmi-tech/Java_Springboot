JVM(java virtual machine) -> is really important for java to run. Java is platform independent..whereas jvm is platform dependent which means we have to install jvm in our machine based on windows, linux and mac os. 
jvm will run only bytecode . so, javaCode -> Compiler -> byteCode -> JVM . we have 100 or 1000 of files to run . but , JVM will run only one file . That one file should contain main method in it. The execution will 
start from first file only. And the signature of main method should be " public static void main(String args[]) " since java is an object oriented language . it needs a class. After it starts to run..but for run, 
needs JRE environment (Java run time environment ) platform . so, jvm + libraries = jre . jdk contains jre . but it is not necessary for other machine to run my code. only jre and jvm is needed.
