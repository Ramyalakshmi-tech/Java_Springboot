JDBC - Java database connectivity

relational database management system (RDBMS) helps to store it in tabular form.
JDBC is an API. It is a part of JDK. It gives an Api to connect with db. many dbs(oracle,postgres,mysql,nosql,h2,db2)
Once i connect app with postsql,need to change to mysql...do i need to change lot of code?
inOrder to avoid it, jdbc has only declared interfaces which will be implemented inside databases.

1. import packages
2. Load driver
3. Register driver
4. create connection
5. create statement
6. execute statement
7. close

Inorder to make it easy, we are using jbdc driver from jdk and H2 from Database side..
In repository layer, we can use some words from spring jpa (save,getStudemt,find etc..)
To talk with database, we have jdbc template
