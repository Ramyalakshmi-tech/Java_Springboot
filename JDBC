JDBC - Java database connectivity

relational database management system (RDBMS) helps to store it in tabular form.
JDBC is an API. It is a part of JDK. It gives an Api to connect with db. many dbs(oracle,postgres,mysql,nosql,h2,db2)
Once i connect app with postsql,need to change to mysql...do i need to change lot of code?
inOrder to avoid it, jdbc has only declared interfaces which will be implemented inside databases.

1. import packages
2. Load driver
3. Register driver
4. create connection
5. create statement
6. execute statement
7. close
