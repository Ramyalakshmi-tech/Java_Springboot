Maven - Project Management tool

the problem there are libraries which are in jar format we have to install for connectors .
For example, spring 5 won't work with hibernate 6 some issues arises.. so, inorder to avoid that, we just install the packages like maven, gradle and ivy.
it contains the compatable version . maven is beginner friendly. it also gives plug ins for testing etc..

ArcheTypes - Templating tool
it is like using the already existed template or creating own template and using it many times.
put all the dependencies in Project object model (POM.xml)... package or library name should be GAV (Group Id, Artifact Id and version)
Maven always look and work from Effective POM.

Sometimes, dependencies are vulnerable..so, maven will search in local , then office folder and then web.
