Postman URL Construction
Base URL:

The server's address where the API is hosted (e.g., http://localhost:8080 for local development or https://api.example.com for production).
Endpoint:

The specific API route (e.g., /users/page).
Query Parameters (for @RequestParam):

Add after a ? in key-value pairs (e.g., ?page=1&size=10).
Path Variables (for @PathVariable):

Replace placeholders in the endpoint (e.g., /users/{id} becomes /users/123).

How to Handle Errors in Postman
Check the Response Status Code:

Postman displays the status code in the response section.
Example: Status: 404 Not Found.
Inspect the Response Body:

APIs often return a JSON object with details about the error.
Example:
