first I have created a service and entity . In entity i add int id, question[] , option[] , answer and getters and setters and constructors and toString().
In service, I added the id,question,opt and ans through the  constructor in entity.
write a scanner to get ans from user and write a method to calculate score in service itself and compare the input with actual ans and increment the ans.
And finally print the score of the quiz.

Abstract class :

the problem is in car class we can declare methods like drive,horn,play music and we didn't define/ implement the method means the buyers knw these are the features
and got surprised why it is not working. just declare the method using abstract keyword. so no class can make a object of this method ....
other class like bmw can extend car and define all the declared absract methods in it, else bmw will become abstract.
And again abstract method can only belong to abstract class.
so, make cat as abstract class.
An abstact class can have normal implemented / non abstract class or abstract class/non implemnted class etc..
