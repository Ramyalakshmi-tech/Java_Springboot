Spring framework:

springboot works on spring framework. If we want to develop enterprise level framework in java , spring framwork is best.
before spring framwork Jakarta enterprise beans (Java beans), web App(struts),databases with ORM ,we use hibernate, 
now all in one called spring framework.Spring is a light weight framwork.it works with POJOs (the plain old java objects)
before , spring works only dependency injection. now it evolved.

Ioc and Di (Inversion of control and Dependency Injection):
A developer should create an object, controls an object and delete the object.....so,it is not needed to be taken care by developer always.
so,Ioc Container in Spring framework will take care of this. so, for example: if we have laptop and cpu ,2 objects are present in IOC container.
but, it should be linked by dependency injection(Design pattern).
